Objective:
In this PA I was supposed to learn/accomplish making a stick game that continues looping until user indicates they no longer want to play,using various user checking techniques, and understanding of functions

Procedure: I began by making an initial design and building off of that design to begin my final design
and flowchart, but I had to begin my code to fully understand how to structure this solution to this problem. 

I faced some challenges understanding the mechanics of functions, but after trying various options for them I was able to get a better
grasp of the topic. I liked working with myself, but the workload feels very overwhelming at times.
